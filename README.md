# -Design-a-compressor-in-telephone-network-
Designed and implemented a compressor circuit. This circuit expands low amplitude voltages and compresses higher voltages               and also suitable to use in an audio system. Tested the circuit using dc power supply and the outcome aligned with the  expected results.
